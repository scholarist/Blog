<p>I&#8217;ve been exploring the idea of writing more short text files on whatever I&#8217;m interested, using the Markdown formatting. That way, I have big directories full of stuff that could theoretically be blogged using Chronicle or Jekyll. Its not a &#8220;one big text file&#8221; solution, but its still a manageable and useful way to organize writing.</p>

<p>This idea has made me more committed to the static blog generators like Jekyll and Chronicle. The latter is the easier of the two to use, its basically plug-and-play. Jekyll is a little fancier but requires more time to learn and set up. If you&#8217;re going to blog like a hacker, you better enjoy hacking, I suppose.</p>

<p>Nice day today, LW and Emmie came down to the mall and had lunch at the lunch carts. Then we bought Emmie some ice cream and watched the ducks by the terrace.</p>

<p>In the evening I picked up some toner for the HP 5-cartridge printer at Office Depot. Usually, restocking costs 40-50 bucks, but tonight I had a coupon from the cartridges I recycled in the spring, so it came to $17. The recycling deposit program makes me buy all my toner at the Depot; I don&#8217;t get that kind of break anywhere else.</p>

<p>Always amazed at the leftover waste when I install new cartridges. I probably cut down a little buying the store-brand cartridges in packs of three. Still, that&#8217;s a lot of stuff left over&#8211;tape, plastic bags and doo-dads. My favorite are those little fliers HP includes that show you all the neat things you can do with your printer, like, you know, print stuff. My idea is that you should buy a complete set of cartridges in a plain brown box that is easily recycled, with no plastic packaging. Its not just the money&#8211;the packaging seems like such a waste. But I have old skool Soviet-style ideas of consumer packaging and that&#8217;s just not how you sell stuff in America. Its probably a good thing that I&#8217;m not running a company.</p>

<p>While at the Depot, I browsed the Asus and Toshiba laptops, and left my favorite Windows 7 app running on each, namely, Notepad.</p>
