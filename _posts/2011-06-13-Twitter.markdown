Virginia Heffernan on [Twitter as a game][1]. 

>It is grounded in the first principles of game theory, including
 variations on the Prisoner's Dilemma. You have to give to get; you
 have to get to give. Managing these ratios, deciding how much of
 your attention to expend to win attention to yourself, say, is the
 lion's share of the Twitter action. 
 
Gamification is getting to be a common marketing trope; try searching
for it on [DuckDuckGo][2]. Gamification is Simon Dumenco wrote about Twitter as a
[game platform][4]. He argued that the #hashtag Olympics on the
service is really an ongoing competition among users to say the
wittiest and/or most offensive thing. Last December I think Heffernan
has written about it in one or another of her columns, probably in a
mention of [Jane McGonigal's][3] _Reality is Broken_.
