Emily Dickinson's [Bible][1] at Harvard, with a scan of a page and a
separate scan of a flower that had been pressed on that page. Dickinson's
religiosity is somewhat disputed: 

>Was Emily Dickinson a religious person? She attended church services
>as a child, and the Dickinsons held daily religious observation in
>their home.  But she rejected the religious revivalism that was so
>prominent a feature of her adolescence, and at some point ceased to
>attend church services altogether: .
>>Some keep the Sabbath going to
>>church / I keep it staying at home. (Fr 236).
